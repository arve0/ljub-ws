# 14. Fixing replay attacks

This is an advanced exercise. If you're not up for it you can skip this one, although promise it'll be lots of fun.

There is a security issue with the solution from the previous exercise. Basically an attacker can intercept a message to the bank (e.i a `withdraw` command) and replay it more than once. That way the bank will receive multiple fake commands and accept them as a valid ones.

Again we can re-use the hash-chain data structure from a previous exercise to solve this.

## Problem

Expand the `bank` program to return the latest hash of the item in the transaction log the customer last appended, every time the customer does an operation (except for register of course since that would always be the first operation).

Have the `teller` store the latest received hash and include this hash in the message that is signed by the signature. That way `bank` can verify the order of a message received from `teller` is correct and not being replayed (if they are the hashes would be different)

## Testing

Try recording a `deposit` message from the teller and send same one multiple times to the bank. The bank should reject any replays.
