# 01. The bank interface

We will first be building a banking server and a teller client. The banking
server represents the bank vault, and the client is what tellers use to
deposit and withdraw funds from the vault. But we're already getting ahead of
ourselves. Let's start with the general bank scaffold.

## Server

To keep everything simple we will be building a simple TCP server that
understands JSON objects:

<details>
  <summary>A javascript example could look something like this.</summary>
  
```js
// bank.js
var jsonStream = require('duplex-json-stream')
var net = require('net')

var server = net.createServer(function (socket) {
  socket = jsonStream(socket)

  socket.on('data', function (msg) {
    console.log('Bank received:', msg)
    // socket.write can be used to send a reply
  })
})

server.listen(3876)
```
</details>


<details>
  <summary>A python example could look something like this.</summary>
  
```python
import socketserver

HOST,PORT = 'localhost', 3876
class TheHandler(socketserver.BaseRequestHandler):
    def handle(self):
        self.data = self.request.recv(1024).strip().decode('utf-8')
        print("Bank received: {}".format(self.data))

socketserver.TCPServer.allow_reuse_address = True
with socketserver.TCPServer((HOST,PORT), TheHandler) as server:
    server.serve_forever()
```
</details>


## Client

To interact with our bank, we will need a client that talks the same protocol.
The server and client are asymmetric, just like in HTTP, so our clients will be
ephemeral, while our server is where state lives.

<details>
  <summary>A javascript example could look something like this.</summary>

```js
// teller.js
var jsonStream = require('duplex-json-stream')
var net = require('net')

var client = jsonStream(net.connect(3876))

client.on('data', function (msg) {
  console.log('Teller received:', msg)
})

// client.end can be used to send a request and close the socket
```
</details>


<details>
  <summary>A python example could look something like this.</summary>

```python
import json
import socket

HOST, PORT = 'localhost', 3876

sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
sock.connect((HOST,PORT))
data = {'cmd': 'balance'}
sock.sendall("{}\n".format(json.dumps(data)).encode('utf-8'))
rec = str(sock.recv(1024), 'utf-8')
print("Teller received: {}".format(rec))
```
</details>

## Problem

First extend the client to send `{cmd: 'balance'}` to the bank, and have the
bank reply with `{cmd: 'balance', balance: 0}`

## Testing

To test your application, open two terminals and run `node bank.js`/`python bank.py` in one
session and run `node teller.js`/`python bank.py` in the other. The teller should print out
`Teller received: {cmd: 'balance', balance: 0}` and exit, while the bank should
print `Bank received: {cmd: 'balance'}` and keep running.
